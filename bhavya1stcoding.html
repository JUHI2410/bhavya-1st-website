<p style="color: darkred;">My favourite sport is basketball. I like it because playing basketball is good for my health. 
    I often play it in the school playground with my classmates. It is an enjoyable and 
    healthy sport which can bring us joy, foster better friendships and help us grow taller.
    Basketball is a team sport.
